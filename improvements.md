# Improvements

## current stack 

We use the following for our current stack at my company

We use the following

S3
Simple Email Service 
Simple Queue Service
Lambdas 
EC2
RDS
OpenSearch
route53
global accelorator
cloudfront
cloudwatch
secret manager
dynamo db
system manager
VPC (so all networking within that)
Elastic Contaiern Service
IAM Identity center
elasticache
cognito 


given this can you please allow me to be to able to search through these easily and create many helper functions around these services? For example gettting the configuration and presenting it nicley. these fucntions should be easily avaialble in the regular console and the py interactive. 

## Easy search commands

Is there a way we can get a resource say an ec2 then i am looking for a specific kind of config really fast like "subnet" and it will fuzzy search the config for that ec2 resource then present that config we found (key or value) that i searched for?
